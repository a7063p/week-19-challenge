  ## Installation
    This application is deployed to Heroku, please follow the above link to access. Additionally, if the user chooses to download the application; Please press "install app" icon in the upper right URL tool bar and follow the instructions.
    
  ## Usage
  This application utilizes service-workers and Index DB so it is fully functional with or without internet/cellular connection. If off-line, Index DB maintains all transactions entered locally. Once connectivity is re-established, the user will see an 'alert' notification that all stored data had been uploaded into the DB. This is done automatically and requires no additional effort on the users end.
